      EdTechUz: Empowering Education through Technology for Teachers project
      aims to address the issues related to the limited teacher resources
      available in Uzbek language and the lack of in-service training for
      educational technologies. This project was developed to support STEM
      teacher trainers using Educational Technology tools to provide students
      with an engaging and interactive learning experience. The project is
      guiding teacher trainers through various EdTech instruments, including
      virtual laboratory simulations, interactive presentations using AI, and
      assessment. The project is designed to cover the study of how teachers
      could use EdTech tools within the public-school program. The project
      focuses on tools and content supporting the National Study plan and
      enhancing the existing Science curriculum.
