        A total of 60 school teachers from urban, suburban, and rural areas
        participated in face-to-face training, while 200 teachers participated
        in a three-day online Edtech mentors training. These mentors are
        providing support to other teachers in their respective schools, with
        each mentor assisting around 30 teachers. The expected outcome is a
        total of 1,800 trained teachers.
